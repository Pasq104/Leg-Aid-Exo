The electronics folder contains all files related to the electrical architecture of the leg-aid-exo module.  
This includes wiring diagrams, PCB interfaces, motor integration details, sensor connections, and firmware utilities required to operate the exoskeleton using the OpenExo control framework.

Content overview:
- **wiring/** — Electrical connection layouts for motors, sensors, battery, and microcontrollers.
- **pcb/** — PCB schematics, pinouts, interface documentation, and fabrication files.
- **firmware/** — Helper scripts, configuration parameters, and communication examples for CAN-based motors and sensors.

These electronics components are designed to integrate seamlessly with the OpenExo PCB and microcontroller setup, which uses a Teensy 4.1 for high-speed control and an Arduino Nano BLE 33 for wireless communication.  
The folder provides everything needed to assemble, modify, and troubleshoot the electrical system for the leg-aid-exo hardware.
